It provides the data structures, algorithms, and library glue needed\nfor most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python.\n\n  - Pandas\n\n   -- *Pandas* provides high-level data structures and functions designed to make working\nwith structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive. Pandas blends the high-performance, array-computing ideas of NumPy with the flex‐\nible data manipulation capabilities of spreadsheets and relational databases (such as\nSQL)\n\n   - matplotlib\n   \n   -- *matplotlib* is the most popular Python library for producing plots and other twodimensional data visualizations\n\n  - IPython and Jupyter\n\n  -- IPython was made to make better interactive python interpreter but now it has become one of the\nmost important tools in the modern Python data stack. IPython is designed from the ground\nup to maximize your productivity in both interactive computing and software devel‐\nopment.\n\n  -- Jupyter project is a broader initiative to design language-agnostic interactive computing tools. The IPython web\nnotebook became the Jupyter notebook, with support now for over 40 programming\nlanguages.\n-- The Jupyter notebook system also allows you to author content in Markdown and\nHTML, providing you a means to create rich documents with code and text.\n   - Scipy\n   \n   -- SciPy is a collection of packages addressing a number of different standard problem\ndomains in scientific computing.\n\n   - scikit-learn\n\n   -- Since the project’s inception in 2010, scikit-learn has become the premier generalpurpose machine learning toolkit for Python programmers.\n\n  - statsmodels\n\n  -- Statsmodels is a statistical analysis package. Compared with scikit-learn, statsmodels contains algorithms for classical (primarily\nfrequentist) statistics and econometrics","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00010-a901fe2c-b484-450b-8c8d-31f7188499a2","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Text Editors\n- Python Interpreter\n- IPython Basics\n  - Running the Jupyter Notebook\n  - Tab Completion\n  - Introspection\n  - Interrupting running code\n   - Executing Code from the Clipboard\n    - Terminal Keyboard Shortcuts\n     - About Magic Commands\n  \n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00011-f6b708d4-75d8-4177-b014-03926cbfd63a","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Python Language Basics\n  - Indentation, not braces\n   - Everything is an object\n    - Comments\n    - Function and object method calls\n   - Variables and argument passing\n\n  - Dynamic references, strong types\n  - Attributes and methods\n   - Imports\n   - Binary operators and comparisons\n  - Mutable and immutable objects\n   - Scalar Types\n   - Numeric types\n  - Strings\n\n  - Bytes and Unicode\n   - Booleans\n   - Type casting\n   - None\n   - Dates and times\n   - Control Flow\n   - Ternary expressions\n   ","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00013-2b64a028-b534-40bb-ade0-3513e5b84e4a","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"8881c981-b96f-49d2-b13b-f8ed691f8d4e","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
